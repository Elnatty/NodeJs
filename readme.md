# ⁢NodeJS Introduction⁡
Before 2009, JS was only available for the browsers, and every browser was competing with each other for in terms of speed and executing the JS code. For that, The needed a JS Engine. Every browser came up with its own Engine. A Javascript Engine is a software component that executes Javascript code, So the faster the engine, the faster the browser.
Chrome: uses V8 Engine (the fastest because it executes using c++)
MS Edge: uses Chakra Core.
Firefox: uses Spider Monkey Engine

As at 2009: a man named Ryan Dahl introduced the NodeJS using the V8 engine.

NodeJS is a free and open source runtime for Javascript, and works on a single thread at a time; meaning you can only do 1 task at a time.
Javascript executes the code, while nodeJS has additional server modules eg filesystem, http, os, etc. which were created using combination of (c, c++, and Javascript), which makes it extremely fast.

> __⁢Features of NodeJS:⁡__
* NodeJS is not a programming Language or a Framework.
* NodeJS is a runtime environment for executing Javascript code.
* NodeJS is ASYNCHRONOUS/Non-blocking in nature.
* its a single threaded platform designed to handle multiple requests.
* NodeJS apps are ASYNCHRONOUS by nature.
* NodeJS is ideal for I/O-intensive apps and highly scalable.
* Do not use Node for CPU-intensive apps.
